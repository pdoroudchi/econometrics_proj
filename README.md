# Gender Wage Gap Oaxaca Decomposition Project

In this project for my Applied Econometrics course at UC Berkeley during Spring 2020, I:

- Performed exploratory analysis on worker wage data to confirm presence of gender wage gap
- Applied Oaxaca decomposition on several nested regression models to assess what portion of the gap is attributable to group differences and what portion cannot be explained by the model
- Results ascertained that the vast majority of the wage gap could not be attributed to factors in the model but rather outside factors
